- Make cvm-mysql call
  mysql_options(MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE, $CVM_MYSQL_DEFAULT_FILE)
  mysql_options(MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP, $CVM_MYSQL_DEFAULT_GROUP)

- Add more fine-grained support to module_local.o for controlling the
  permissions of the socket file (owner, permissions).

- Use the str library for all strings.

- Add support for allow/deny tables

  - File based: if $CVM_ACCESS/deny/$USER exists, or if
    $CVM_ACCESS/allow exists and $CVM_ACCESS/allow/$USER does not
    exist, deny the user.  Call a common function to test.

  - SQL modules: add an extra required boolean column to the query.

- Write a module to do lookups from a CDB file, as well as a tool to
  manipulate that file "cdbpasswd".

- Document the second protocol as either CVM2 or XCVM.
  - See http://lists.em.ca/?command=monthbythread&list=bgware&month=200105

- Stop using perror.

- Stop using stdio.

- Split into cvm (containing the main modules) and lib/cvm (containing
  the client/module code).

- Consider how to do a "union" module that would call other modules and
  use the results from the first one that succeeds.

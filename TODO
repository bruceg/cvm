- Modify spec to break the MySQL and PgSQL modules into seperate
  sub-packages.

- Build up a standardize password checking framework:
  - Library spawns a secondary module, with pipes connected to standard
    input and output.
  - For each check, write the plaintext and stored pass phrase as two
    NUL-terminated strings to standard input of the module.
  - The module will write a single byte to standard output, zero for a
    successful comparison, and non-zero otherwise.

- Modify cvm-{mysql,pgsql,pwfile} to use to above interface.

- Build up a set of password checking modules as a seperate package.

- Write modules to do lookups from:
  - CDB file
  - Both passwd and one of the other modules.

- Add some method for modules to signal a "fatal" error to the library,
  such that the module will exit after the error is reported to the
  client.  Use this in the SQL modules when the queries can't complete.

- Document the second protocol as either CVM2 or XCVM.

<h1>CVM Credential Definitions</h1>

<h2>Types</h2>

<p>Credentials may have one of two types:<ul>

<li><tt>string</tt>: An arbitrary length series of ASCII characters not
containing <tt>NUL</tt>.

<li><tt>integer</tt>: A series of ASCII digits interpreted as an
unsigned decimal value.</tt>

</ul></p>

<h2>Numbering</h2>

<p>All predefined credential numbers will have values betweehn 1 and
127 inclusive.  All other credential numbers (from 128 to 255) are
reserved for local or experimental use.  Credentials may be given to
the module in any order that is convenient to the client, and that
order carries no significance.  Unless otherwise specified, each fact
must be present at most once in the input.</p>

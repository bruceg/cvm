<h1>CVM Fact Numbers</h1>

other fact numbers are reserved for local or experimental use.  Facts
marked as "required" must be present at least once in the result.
Facts marked as "multiple" may be present more than once; all other
facts must be present at most once.  Facts may be reported in any
order, and that order carries no significance.</p>

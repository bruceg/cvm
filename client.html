<h1>CVM Client Library</h1>

<p>The CVM client library defines the following functions:<dl>

<dt><tt>int authenticate(const char* module, const char**
credentials)</tt> <dd><p>This is the main entry point to the library.
Simply set up the account name and credentials as an array with a
trailing NULL pointer and call <tt>authenticate</tt>.  The function
will return 0 if authentication succeeded and 100 for permanent
failure.  Anything else is a temporary failure.</p>

<p>If authentication succeeds, this routine automatically retrieves
<tt>fact_username</tt>, <tt>fact_userid</tt>, <tt>fact_groupid</tt>,
<tt>fact_directory</tt>, and <tt>fact_shell</tt>.
<tt>fact_realname</tt>, <tt>fact_groupname</tt>,
<tt>fact_sys_username</tt>, and <tt>fact_sys_directory</tt> are also
set if they were present in the results.</p>

<dt><tt>int fact_str(int number, const char** data)</tt>
<dd><p>Retrieves a fact from the data returned by the module as a
NUL-terminated string.  Returns non-zero if the fact was present.</p>

<dt><tt>int fact_uint(int number, unsigned** data)</tt>
<dd><p>Retrieves a fact from the data returned by the module as an
unsigned integer.  Returns non-zero if the fact was present and was an
unsigned integer.</p>

</dl></p>

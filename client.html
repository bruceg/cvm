<h1>CVM Client Library</h1>

<p>The CVM client library defines the following functions:<dl>

<dt><tt>int cvm_authenticate(const char* module, const char**
credentials)</tt> <dd><p>This is the main entry point to the library.
Simply set up the account name and credentials as an array with a
trailing NULL pointer and call <tt>authenticate</tt>.  The function
will return 0 if authentication succeeded and an <a
href="errors.html">error code</a> otherwise.</p>

<p>If authentication succeeds, this routine automatically retrieves
<tt>cvm_fact_username</tt>, <tt>cvm_fact_userid</tt>,
<tt>cvm_fact_groupid</tt>, <tt>cvm_fact_directory</tt>, and
<tt>cvm_fact_shell</tt>.  <tt>cvm_fact_realname</tt>,
<tt>cvm_fact_groupname</tt>, <tt>cvm_fact_sys_username</tt>, and
<tt>cvm_fact_sys_directory</tt> are also set if they were present in
the results.</p>

<dt><tt>int cvm_fact_str(int number, const char** data)</tt>
<dd><p>Retrieves a <a href="facts.html">fact</a> from the data
returned by the module as a NUL-terminated string.  Returns zero if
the fact was present, and <tt>CVME_NOFACT</tt> otherwise.  Successive
calls to this function with the same <tt>number</tt> return subsequent
facts if more than one instance of the fact was present.</p>

<dt><tt>int cvm_fact_uint(int number, unsigned long* data)</tt>
<dd><p>Retrieves a <a href="facts.html">fact</a> from the data
returned by the module as an unsigned integer.  Returns zero if the
fact was present and was an unsigned integer.  Returns
<tt>CVME_BAD_MODDATA</tt> if the fact was present but was not an
unsigned integer.  Successive calls to this function with the same
<tt>number</tt> return subsequent facts if more than one instance of
the fact was present.</p>

</dl></p>

<h1>CVM Design Rationale</h1>

<h2>Design Rationale</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Single credential type per module. <dd>Eliminating the choice of
credential types from the logic required by the modules simplifies the
support code required by those modules.  In fact, it should also
simplify the code required by the invoking code, since the invoker
will necessarily have different handling for reading and parsing
different credential types from a client.  Servers that only handle
one type of credentials do not have to deal with this detail.

<dt>Variable fact list. <dd>There is no one list of facts that must be
reported by an authenticator.  This list that is reported may be
extended to include more optional facts.

<dt>Single-byte fact identifiers. <dd>Simplifying identifier names
into a single byte greatly simplifies parsing code, without making the
output code any more complex, and without significantly reducing the
range of facts that can be expressed.

<dt>No chaining. <dd>What was accomplished by chaining with Courier's
authentication modules can be better accomplished through other means.
If multiple types of authentication for the same credentials can
occur, run seperate services on seperate IPs that use different CVM
modules.  If multiple types of credentials are used, they will each
invoke a seperate CVM module.  This eliminates all of the coding and
design headaches associated with chaining Courier IMAP authentication
modules.

<dt>No execution by the module. <dd>With the checkpassword interface,
the authentication module drops root priviledges before executing the
second stage program.  This however greatly reduces or eliminates the
feasability of executing the unpriviledged second stage program in a
chroot environment for additional security.

<dt>Limited input and output size. <dd>Limiting the total input and
output and output size to reasonable values eliminates one class of
denial of service attacks by limiting the amount of memory required
for buffers and parsing on both the part of the module and the
invoker.

<dt>512 byte request and response maximum sizes. <dd>A single UDP
frame is limited to 512 bytes without introducing serious transmission
reliability problems.  The UDP response also contains a single byte
indicating success/failure that the executable-mode programs transmit
out-of-bad through the program's exit code.

<dt>Options for long-running server modules. <dd>Long-running server
modules provide opportunities for caching of credential information
that may otherwise take significant amounts of time to fetch.

<dt>Options for both UNIX domain and UDP server modules. <dd>Through
the standard UNIX permission model, system administrators can restrict
access to UNIX domain servers.  Administrators of clusters can use UDP
modules to provide centralized authentication services.

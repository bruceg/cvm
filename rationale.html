<h1>CVM Design Rationale</h1>

<h2>Design Rationale</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Single credential type <dd>Eliminating the choice of credential
types from the logic required by the modules simplifies the support
code required by those modules.  In fact, it should also simplify the
code required by the invoking code, since the invoker will necessarily
have different handling for reading and parsing different credential
types from a client.  Servers that only handle one type of credentials
do not have to deal with this detail.

<dt>Variable fact format <dd>There is no one list of facts that must
be reported by such an authenticator.  This list that is reported may
be extended to include more optional facts.

<dt>Single-byte fact identifiers <dd>Simplifying identifier names into
a single byte greatly simplifies parsing code, without making the
output code any more complex, and without significantly reducing the
range of facts that can be expressed.

<dt>No chaining <dd>Chaining of authentication modules is the
responsibility of the invoking code rather than that of the
authentication module.  This eliminates most of the coding headaches
associated with chaining Courier IMAP authentication modules, without
adding significant additional code to the invoker.

<dt>No execution by the module <dd>With the checkpassword interface,
the authentication module drops root priviledges before executing the
unpriviledged code.  This however greatly reduces or eliminates the
feasability of executing the unpriviledged module in a chroot
environment for additional security.

<dt>Limited input and output size <dd>Limiting the total input and
output and output size to reasonable values eliminates one class of
denial of service attacks by limiting the amount of memory required
for buffers and parsing on both the part of the module and the
invoker.

<dt>512 byte request and 511 byte response maximum sizes <dd>A single
UDP frame is limited to 512 bytes without introducing serious
transmission reliability problems.  The UDP response also contains a
single byte indicating success/failure that the executable-mode
programs transmit out-of-bad through the program's exit code.

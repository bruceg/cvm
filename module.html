<h1>CVM Module Library</h1>

<p>To write a module using the CVM module library, you must provide
the following items:<dl>

<dt><tt>const unsigned cvm_credential_count</tt> <dd>Set this global
to the number of credentials required from the client.

<dt><tt>const char* cvm_credentials[X]</tt>, where X is the same as
<tt>credential_count</tt> above <dd>Pointers to the credentials read
from the client are stored in this array.

<dt><tt>int cvm_auth_init(void)</tt> <dd>This routine is called once
when the CVM starts up.

<dt><tt>int cvm_lookup(void)</tt> <dd>This routine is used to look up
the stored credentials for the named user.

<dt><tt>int cvm_authenticate(void)</tt> <dd>The main authentication
verification routine.  This routine is not called when the module is
operating in lookup mode.

<dt><tt>void cvm_auth_stop(void)</tt> <dd>This routine is called once
when the CVM is shut down.

</dl>

Before <tt>cvm_lookup()</tt> is called, the input data stream is read
and the account name is parsed into <tt>cvm_account_name</tt>, the
domain name into <tt>cvm_account_domain</tt>, and the credentials are
parsed into <tt>cvm_credentials</tt>.</p>

<p>If authentication fails, the module must return
<tt>CVME_PERMFAIL</tt> (value 100).  If there was a temporary error,
return any other non-zero number <a href="errors.html">error code</a>.
Otherwise, return zero after setting <tt>cvm_fact_username</tt>,
<tt>cvm_fact_userid</tt>, <tt>cvm_fact_groupid</tt>,
<tt>cvm_fact_directory</tt>, and <tt>cvm_fact_shell</tt>, which will
be automatically sent to the client when <tt>authenticate()</tt>
completes.  <tt>cvm_fact_realname</tt>, <tt>cvm_fact_groupname</tt>,
<tt>cvm_fact_sys_username</tt>, <tt>cvm_fact_sys_directory</tt>, and
<tt>cvm_fact_domain</tt> will also be sent if they are set.  If any
other facts are to be returned to the client, send them with
<tt>cvm_fact_str(int number, const char* data)</tt> or
<tt>cvm_fact_uint(int number, unsigned data)</tt>.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The functions supplied by the module must never exit
except on fatal errors.  If any memory is allocated in the course of
processing a request, it must either be freed or reallocated on the next
invocation.</p>

<p>Each module will implement at least one type of credential
validation (ie plain text, CRAM, etc).  Modules are not obligated to
implement multiple types of validation, but may do so by examinimg
which credentials are present in the input.  The invoker will choose
which modules to invoke depending on what type of credentials it needs
validated.</p>

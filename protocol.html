<h1>CVM Protocol</h1>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>Input to the authenticator is as follows.  All items are
NUL-terminated strings.  The total length of the input must not exceed
512 bytes.<ol>

<li>Account identifier (ie user name).

<li>List of credentials.

</ol></p>

<p>The credentials consist of one of the following:<ul>

<li>For plain login, the password.

<li>For APOP, the timestamp and MD5 digest.

<li>For CRAM-MD5 keyed hashing, as specified in RFC 2095, the
challenge and MD5 digest.

</ul></p>

<p>Each module will implement a single type of credential validation.
The invoker will choose which modules to invoke depending on what type
of credentials it needs validated.</p>

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<p>The following environment variables may be set by the invoker:<dl>

<dt><tt>SERVICE</tt> <dl>The service name, to be used (for example) by
PAM modules to determine which configuration file to load.

</dl></p>

<h2>Program Return Values</h2>

<p>An authenticator will report a list of facts and exit 0 if
authentication succeeds.  If this module cannot handle the given
credentials, the module will exit 111 (temporary failure).  If the
credentials are accepted by this module, but are not valid, the module
will exit 100 (permanent failure).  Any other exit code is
undefined.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>If authentication succeeds, the output from the module is a list of
facts about the authenticator.  Each fact consists of a single byte
identifying what type of fact is being reported, followed by a
sequence of zero or more non-zero bytes, terminated by a single NUL
byte.  A second NUL byte follows the last fact and indicates the end
of the list.  The total size of the output must not exceed 511
bytes.</p>

<p>All predefined facts use values less than 128.  All other fact
values are reserved for local or experimental use.  Facts marked as
"required" must be present at least once in the result.  Facts marked
as "multiple" may be present more than once; all other facts must be
present at most once.  Facts may be reported in any order, and that
order carries no significance.  All numbers are expressed in ASCII
decimal.</p>

<p><ul>

<li><tt>1</tt> (required) The login user name.

<li><tt>2</tt> (required) The user numerical ID.

<li><tt>3</tt> (required) The group numerical ID.

<li><tt>4</tt> (optional) The user's real name.

<li><tt>5</tt> (required) The "home" directory.

<li><tt>6</tt> (required) The login shell.

<li><tt>7</tt> (optional) The login group name, as reported by the
system tables.

<li><tt>8</tt> (multiple) One supplemental group ID.

<li><tt>9</tt> (optional) The system user name.  For virtual login
systems, this may differ from fact #1.  Where present, this should be
the user name associated with the user ID as reported by the system
tables (ie <tt>getpwuid</tt>).

<li><tt>10</tt> (optional) The base "home" directory.  For virtual
login systems, this may differ from fact #5.  Where present, this
should be the directory associated with the user ID as reported by the
system tables (ie <tt>getpwuid</tt>).

</ul></p>

<h2>Code Considerations</h2>

<p>The module must exit 111 if it detects malformed input (too few
credentials, etc.).  Extra input is a fault in the invoking code, and
may produce undefined results.</p>

<p>The invoker must assume a temporary error if the module either
fails to completely read its input or produces incomplete output, even
if the module exits without error.</p>

<p>All error codes other than 100 should be treated as temporary
errors.</p>

<p>If multiple authentication types are part of the scheme (ex POP3
allows plain and APOP logins, and requires seperate modules for each),
the invoking code should be configured to execute a list of modules
until one either succeeds or exits 100.</p>

<p>The invoking code should change directory to the named home
directory and drop root priviledges as soon as possible after
successful authentication.  Where reasonable, the invoking code should
also chroot to the directory for added protection.</p>

<p>CVM is a framework for validating a set of credentials against a
database using a filter program.  The modules act as a filter, taking
a set of credentials as input and writing a set of facts as output if
those credentials are valid.  Optional input is given to the module
through environment variables.</p>

<p>Some of the ideas for CVM came from experience with the <a
http="http://cr.yp.to/checkpwd.html">checkpassword</a> interface used
by <tt>qmail-pop3d</tt>, and the "authmod" interface used by Courier
IMAP and POP3.  This framework places fewer restrictions on the
invoking client than checkpassword does, and is much simpler to
implement on both sides than the authmod framework.</p>

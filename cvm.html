<h1>CVM: Credential Validation Module</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>CVM is a framework for validating a set of credentials against a
database using a filter program.  The modules act as a filter, taking
a set of credentials as input and writing a set of facts as output if
those credentials are valid.  Optional input is given to the module
through environment variables.</p>

<p>Some of the ideas for CVM came from experience with the <a
http="http://cr.yp.to/checkpwd.html">checkpassword</a> interface used
by <tt>qmail-pop3d</tt>, and the "authmod" interface used by Courier
IMAP and POP3.  This framework places fewer restrictions on the
invoking client than checkpassword does, and is much simpler to
implement on both sides than the authmod framework.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>Input to the authenticator is as follows.  All items are
NUL-terminated strings.  The total length of the input must not exceed
4096 bytes.<ol>

<li>Account identifier (ie user name).

<li>List of credentials.

</ol></p>

<p>The credentials consist of one of the following:<ul>

<li>For plain login, the password.

<li>For APOP, the timestamp and MD5 digest.

<li>For CRAM-MD5 keyed hashing, as specified in RFC 2095, the
challenge and MD5 digest.

</ul></p>

<p>Each module will implement a single type of credential validation.
The invoker will choose which modules to invoke depending on what type
of credentials it needs validated.</p>

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<p>The following environment variables may be set by the invoker:<dl>

<dt><tt>SERVICE</tt> <dl>The service name, to be used (for example) by
PAM modules to determine which configuration file to load.

</dl></p>

<h2>Return Values</h2>

<p>An authenticator will report a list of facts and exit 0 if
authentication succeeds.  If this module cannot handle the given
credentials, the module will exit 111 (temporary failure).  If the
credentials are accepted by this module, but are not valid, the module
will exit 100 (permanent failure).  Any other exit code is
undefined.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>If authentication succeeds, the output from the module is a list of
facts about the authenticator.  Each fact consists of a single byte
identifying what type of fact is being reported, followed by a
sequence of zero or more non-zero bytes, terminated by a single NUL
byte.  A second NUL byte follows the last fact and indicates the end
of the list.  The total size of the output must not exceed 4096
bytes.</p>

<p>All predefined facts use values less than 128.  All other fact
values are reserved for local or experimental use.  Facts marked as
"required" must be present at least once in the result.  Facts marked
as "multiple" may be present more than once; all other facts must be
present at most once.  Facts may be reported in any order, and that
order carries no significance.  All numbers are expressed in ASCII
decimal.</p>

<p><ul>

<li><tt>1</tt> (required) The login user name.

<li><tt>2</tt> (required) The user numerical ID.

<li><tt>3</tt> (required) The group numerical ID.

<li><tt>4</tt> (optional) The user's real name.

<li><tt>5</tt> (required) The "home" directory.

<li><tt>6</tt> (required) The login shell.

<li><tt>7</tt> (optional) The login group name, as reported by the
system tables.

<li><tt>8</tt> (multiple) One supplemental group ID.

<li><tt>9</tt> (optional) The system user name.  For virtual login
systems, this may differ from fact #1.  Where present, this should be
the user name associated with the user ID as reported by the system
tables (ie <tt>getpwuid</tt>).

<li><tt>10</tt> (optional) The base "home" directory.  For virtual
login systems, this may differ from fact #5.  Where present, this
should be the directory associated with the user ID as reported by the
system tables (ie <tt>getpwuid</tt>).

</ul></p>

<h2>Code Considerations</h2>

<p>The module must exit 111 if it detects malformed input (too few
credentials, etc.).  Extra input is a fault in the invoking code, and
may produce undefined results.</p>

<p>The invoker must assume a temporary error if the module either
fails to completely read its input or produces incomplete output, even
if the module exits without error.</p>

<p>All error codes other than 100 should be treated as temporary
errors.</p>

<p>If multiple authentication types are part of the scheme (ex POP3
allows plain and APOP logins, and requires seperate modules for each),
the invoking code should be configured to execute a list of modules
until one either succeeds or exits 100.</p>

<p>The invoking code should change directory to the named home
directory and drop root priviledges as soon as possible after
successful authentication.  Where reasonable, the invoking code should
also chroot to the directory for added protection.</p>

<h2>Design Rationale</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Single credential type <dd>Eliminating the choice of credential
types from the logic required by the modules simplifies the support
code required by those modules.  In fact, it should also simplify the
code required by the invoking code, since the invoker will necessarily
have different handling for reading and parsing different credential
types from a client.  Servers that only handle one type of credentials
do not have to deal with this detail.

<dt>Variable fact format <dd>There is no one list of facts that must
be reported by such an authenticator.  This list that is reported may
be extended to include more optional facts.

<dt>Single-byte fact identifiers <dd>Simplifying identifier names into
a single byte greatly simplifies parsing code, without making the
output code any more complex, and without significantly reducing the
range of facts that can be expressed.

<dt>No chaining <dd>Chaining of authentication modules is the
responsibility of the invoking code rather than that of the
authentication module.  This eliminates most of the coding headaches
associated with chaining Courier IMAP authentication modules, without
adding significant additional code to the invoker.

<dt>No execution by the module <dd>With the checkpassword interface,
the authentication module drops root priviledges before executing the
unpriviledged code.  This however greatly reduces or eliminates the
feasability of executing the unpriviledged module in a chroot
environment for additional security.

<dt>Limited input and output size <dd>Limiting the total input and
output and output size to reasonable values eliminates one class of
denial of service attacks by limiting the amount of memory required
for buffers and parsing on both the part of the module and the
invoker.

</dl>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>This interface is not directly compatible with either checkpassword
or Courier auth modules.  Direct compatibility was not a design
consideration.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Checkpassword <dd>

<p>It should be fairly simple to write a checkpassword module that can
invoke a chain of authentictor modules and execute a command line upon
success, thus providing compatibility with programs that require a
checkpassword interface.</p>

<p>It should be possible, but not necessarily straightforward or
efficient to provide an authenticator module that executes a
checkpassword module and provides results from it.</p>

<dt>Courier "authlib" modules <dd>

<p>It should be fairly simple to write a auth module that can invoke
an authenticator.</p>

<p>I am unsure about the feasability of writing a authenticator module
that can invoke auth modules.</p>

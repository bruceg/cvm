Requirements:

- bglibs library package version 1.020 or later.
- The vmailmgr modules should work with all versions of vmailmgr that
  use CDB password tables, introduced in vmailmgr version 0.89 (only
  tested with version 0.96.9)

Installation:

- Make sure the latest version of bglibs from
  http://untroubled.org/bglibs/ is compiled and installed.
- Build the sources by running "make"
- Run the "instshow" command to see what will be installed (optional).
- After the package has been compiled, run the following commands as root:
	./installer
	./instcheck
  These commands will produce no output if there are no errors.

vmailmgr Configuration:

- If your virtual domain password tables are stored in a file other than
  passwd.cdb, set $VMAILMGR_PWFILE to that file name.

- Set $QMAIL_ROOT to the base qmail directory (defaults to "/var/qmail").

- Set $VMAILMGR_DEFAULT to the vmailmgr default username (defaults to "+").

- Set $DEBUG (to anything) to see debugging output.

- See http://untroubled.org/cvm/cvm.html for information on running
  local or UDP server modules.

Changes in version 0.7

- Added a text-file module, cvm-pwfile.

- Modified the client and module APIs to add "cvm_" in front of all
  exported symbols.

- Added a required function "cvm_auth_init" to the module API, which is
  called once at program startup.

- Modified cvm-unix to output the group name and the supplemental group
  list.

- Fixed the APIs to use "unsigned long" for the integer type instead of
  just "unsigned".

- Fixed the client library to properly handle lists of facts.

- Fixed use of iopoll to properly support systems with a missing or broken
  poll syscall.

Note: This release doesn't make any of the protocol changes discussed in
the mailing lists.  Since those changes are fairly radical, they will go
into a second version of CVM, named either CVM2 or CVMX or something.

  NFS mounted file shares.

  a library.

Changes in version 0.16

- Merged cvm-sasl library from bglibs into this package.

- Bug fix for SIGPIPE (on at least Solaris) if modules exit unexpectedly
  (from Lars Uffmann).

- Modified the module command mode to always write the output, even if
  authentication failed.  This allows command mode to be used with a
  UCSPI server to provide other modes of servers.

- The module library now allows for setting the ownership of the created
  local socket by setting $CVM_SOCKET_MODE, $CVM_SOCKET_OWNER, and
  $CVM_SOCKET_GROUP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.15

- Added a new generic module library that supports all three operation
  modes (command, local socket, UDP socket) from the same binary.  The
  separated module libraries have been retained for compatibility, but
  the separated modules have been removed from this package.

- Fixed cvm-unix to properly handle shadow passwords.

  getpwnam.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.10

- Added support to the MySQL and PgSQL modules for executing a query
  after credential validation, useful for updating a "last logged in at"
  field or similar.

- Modified the client->server protocol to include a protocol identifier
  byte (to allow for future revisions) and a domain name.

- Modified the client library to optionally parse a domain name out of
  the account name.

- Modified the MySQL and PgSQL modules to deal with domain names.

- The MySQL module will now read connection options out of a defaults
  file if specified.

NOTE:  Modules built against this version of CVM will be incompatible
with clients built against older versions, and vice versa!  Use care
when upgrading.

Changes in version 0.8

- Added additional error codes.

- Added a MySQL module.

- Use pwcmp for password comparisons in all modules except for cvm-unix.

- Added a required function "cvm_auth_stop" to the module API, which is
  called once at module shutdown.

- Bug fix in the cvm-unix module from Paul Jarc to make the supplemental
  group id list reported by cvm-unix actually follow the fact
  specification.

- Bug fix in the client library code that caused the shell fact to be
  required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7

- Added a text-file module, cvm-pwfile.

- Modified the client and module APIs to add "cvm_" in front of all
  exported symbols.

- Added a required function "cvm_auth_init" to the module API, which is
  called once at program startup.

- Modified cvm-unix to output the group name and the supplemental group
  list.

- Fixed the APIs to use "unsigned long" for the integer type instead of
  just "unsigned".

- Fixed the client library to properly handle lists of facts.

- Fixed use of iopoll to properly support systems with a missing or broken
  poll syscall.

Note: This release doesn't make any of the protocol changes discussed in
the mailing lists.  Since those changes are fairly radical, they will go
into a second version of CVM, named either CVM2 or CVMX or something.

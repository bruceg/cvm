Changes in version 0.10

- Added support to the MySQL and PgSQL modules for executing a query
  after credential validation, useful for updating a "last logged in at"
  field or similar.

- Modified the client->server protocol to include a protocol identifier
  byte (to allow for future revisions) and a domain name.

- Modified the client library to optionally parse a domain name out of
  the account name.

- Modified the MySQL and PgSQL modules to deal with domain names.

- The MySQL module will now read connection options out of a defaults
  file if specified.

NOTE:  Modules built against this version of CVM will be incompatible
with clients built against older versions, and vice versa!  Use care
when upgrading.

  group id list reported by cvm-unix actually follow the fact
  specification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7

- Added a text-file module, cvm-pwfile.

- Modified the client and module APIs to add "cvm_" in front of all
  exported symbols.

- Added a required function "cvm_auth_init" to the module API, which is
  called once at program startup.

- Modified cvm-unix to output the group name and the supplemental group
  list.

- Fixed the APIs to use "unsigned long" for the integer type instead of
  just "unsigned".

- Fixed the client library to properly handle lists of facts.

- Fixed use of iopoll to properly support systems with a missing or broken
  poll syscall.

Note: This release doesn't make any of the protocol changes discussed in
the mailing lists.  Since those changes are fairly radical, they will go
into a second version of CVM, named either CVM2 or CVMX or something.

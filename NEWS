-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.50

* This version is a major upgrade providing support for the CVM2
* protocol.  All the modules included here now support both the new CVM2
* protocol and the existing CVM1 protocol.  There are two seperate
* client libraries, cvm-v1client and cvm-v2client.  The previous library
* and header names are retained as symlinks to the v1client files.

NOTE: The version 1 client library is now depricated and may be removed
in future versions of the package.  All new software should target the
version 2 API.

Changes in version 0.31

- Changed error code in the qmail code from EBADMSG to EDOM to allow
  compilation on *BSD systems.

This is strictly a compile-fix version.  If the previous version

  recipient addresses on qmail systems.

  modules, making them more conformant to qmail's delivery process.

  NFS mounted file shares.

Changes in version 0.17

- Bug fix for SIGPIPE (on at least Solaris) if modules exit unexpectedly
  (from Lars Uffmann).

  authentication failed.  This allows command mode to be used with a
  UCSPI server to provide other modes of servers.

- The module library now allows for setting the ownership of the created
  local socket by setting $CVM_SOCKET_MODE, $CVM_SOCKET_OWNER, and
  $CVM_SOCKET_GROUP.

  modes (command, local socket, UDP socket) from the same binary.  The
  separated module libraries have been retained for compatibility, but
  the separated modules have been removed from this package.

  getpwnam.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.10

- Added support to the MySQL and PgSQL modules for executing a query
  after credential validation, useful for updating a "last logged in at"
  field or similar.

- Modified the client->server protocol to include a protocol identifier
  byte (to allow for future revisions) and a domain name.

- Modified the client library to optionally parse a domain name out of
  the account name.

- Modified the MySQL and PgSQL modules to deal with domain names.

- The MySQL module will now read connection options out of a defaults
  file if specified.

NOTE:  Modules built against this version of CVM will be incompatible
with clients built against older versions, and vice versa!  Use care
when upgrading.

  group id list reported by cvm-unix actually follow the fact
  specification.

- Bug fix in the client library code that caused the shell fact to be
  required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7

- Added a text-file module, cvm-pwfile.

  exported symbols.

  called once at program startup.

  list.

- Fixed the APIs to use "unsigned long" for the integer type instead of
  just "unsigned".

- Fixed the client library to properly handle lists of facts.

  poll syscall.

Note: This release doesn't make any of the protocol changes discussed in
the mailing lists.  Since those changes are fairly radical, they will go
into a second version of CVM, named either CVM2 or CVMX or something.
